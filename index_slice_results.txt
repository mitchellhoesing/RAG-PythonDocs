Prompt:

 Human: 
Answer the question based only on the following context:

>>> list(range(5, 10)) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))

[0, 3, 6, 9]

>>> list(range(

10,

100,

30))

[

10,

40,

70]

To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine "range()" and "len()" as follows:

>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb'] >>> for i in range(len(a)): ...     print(i, a[i]) ... 0 Mary 1 had 2 a 3 little 4 lamb

In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the "enumerate()" function, see Looping Techniques.

A strange thing happens if you just print a range:

>>> range(10)

range(0, 10)

In many ways the object returned by "range()" behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn't. It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn't really make the list, thus saving space.

We say such an object is *iterable*, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted.  We have seen that the "for" statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is "sum()":

>>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 6

Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments.  In chapter Data Structures, we will discuss in more detail about "list()".

Deletion is more straightforward:

>>> a = range(4)

>>> a

[0, 1, 2, 3]

>>> a[::2]

[0, 2]

>>> del a[::2]

>>> a

[1, 3]

One can also now pass slice objects to the "__getitem__()" methods of the built-in sequences:

>>> range(10).__getitem__(slice(0, 5, 2))

[0, 2, 4]

Or use slice objects directly in subscripts:

>>> range(10)[slice(0, 5, 2)]

[0, 2, 4]

To simplify implementing sequences that support extended slicing, slice objects now have a method "indices(length)" which, given the length of a sequence, returns a "(start, stop, step)" tuple that can be passed directly to "range()". "indices()" handles omitted and out- of-bounds indices in a manner consistent with regular slices (and this innocuous phrase hides a welter of confusing details!).  The method is intended to be used like this:
